# SeisFEM

This project is for our class project for Computational Seismology at USTC.
The team members include: Haipeng Li, Hongbo Han, and Wancong Zhao
I will continue to update this repository for more features later.

## How to use

#### For regular mesh,

##### 	 run: Case1_SEM_inner_mesh.m

#### For irregular mesh:

##### 	 run: Case2_SEM_use_Gmsh_mesh.m		

```bash
 1. Use the topography data (x and z) to generate mymesh.geo file by running Write_Gmsh.m;
 2. Load the mymesh.geo file into Gmsh and click: Mesh->2D. Then save the mesh by clicking: File->Save Mesh
 3. Run Case2_SEM_use_Gmsh_mesh.m 
 Please notice that the order of the mesh generated by Gmsh should be the same with that in the main code. Here, P=4 is used.
```
